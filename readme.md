dotabuff-ripper
===============

A tool for ripping off dotabuff's data. 
It can go through all the heroes, and for each hero grab all the statistics from dotabuff.
We can scrape the website for matchups data, no problem. 

Installation
------------

### Windows Install
A lot more work to make a vanilla windows install "sane" (to have gcc, make, etc). A lot of gems are broken in win 64 bit. The only workaround that I am able to do is to install 32bit version of ruby 2.0.0p195 and its compatible Devkit. The gems are then getting installed fine on the 32 bit ruby platform (running on windows 8 64bit). Are you really needing to process/allocate more than 2GB of RAM in your Ruby processes? Because if not, then you don't need 64bits Ruby or Nokogiri.
#### Install binaries
1. [Install ruby 2.0.0-p247](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
2. [Install neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/download/windows)
3. Install [git and cygwin](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe&can=2&q=) select 3rd option "Run Git and included Unix tools from the WIndows Command Prompt"
4. Optional but recommended if developing [install rubymine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download/)

#### Setup dir
1. Clone the [dotabuff-ripper repo](https://github.com/sunapi386/dotabuff-ripper)
2. Seed the neo4j db: unzip the included neo4j database into `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Neo4j\` and startup Neo4j Community and set database location to the seed
3. [Install the Ruby 2.0 development kit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), instructions [here](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit)
Note if you use x64 bit then you may run into a config.yml not valid problem. See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16523607/cant-get-ruby-devkit-configuration-file-autogenerated-properly/).
4. Open `cmd` and `gem install bundler`
5. Go to `dotabuff-ripper` folder and `bundle install`
6. Of course.. it fails to install nokoguiri because they don't have support for x64 ruby 2.0.0! Stuck for now

### Linux Install
1. Requires Ruby 2.0.0 and Neo4j database.
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle install`
4. Seed the db by extracting graph.db.zip into the neo4j data folder
5. Visit `localhost:7474` for graphical db interface
6. `ruby test/prompt.rb`


What useful information can we come up with?
--------------------------------------------

There are 102 heroes, and each hero has 101 matchup statistics against other heroes. 
The list of heroes is

and the kind of data scrapped for each hero is

### A quick detour into DotA
In all games there are two teams, each can pick 5 heroes. Certain modes of the game allows "banning" of heroes. In captain's mode you ban 5 heroes; in captain's draft, 2; in random draft there is no banning, both teams pick from a pool of 20 heroes. 
The goal is to ban the heroes that counters your picks. Let our team was called red and blue.
Captain's mode goes like this:

    blue ban => red ban => blue ban => red ban;
    blue pick => red pick => red pick => blue pick;
    blue ban => red ban => blue ban => red ban
    red pick => blue pick => red pick => blue pick;
    red ban => blue ban; red pick => blue pick.

### Using graphs 
I think there's a bit of graph theory that can be used, as to what to do with this data. Let each hero be a vertex. An edge in G1 be weight :advantage, and in G2 :winrate. With graphs G1 and G2 we can infer something about:
- what are the worst enemies for your current setup
- who you need the most to synergize and balance

#### Neo4j graph database
Neo4j is a graph based db, its query http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.0/ should make db more useful for analysis than traditional table-based dbs. I have Neo4j 2.0.0-M06 community edition for Unix, from http://www.neo4j.org/. Just install and run, and you can use the `grapher.rb` script to populate it with data.
Originally, I've generated a query for constructing my dataset, and it was 10,405 lines long. I tried to paste it as a Cypher query, I waited 2 hours and nothing happened. It wasn't until I looked at the console.log did I discover that it silently stack-overflowed while parsing the query! 
I read up about creating queries individually, and managed to make my edges between the vertices. Take a look at the `png` files in example folder.

Q: Why even use a DB? 10k edges fits easily in memory of your interpreter. You can even dump it to a YAML file for storage.

A: Well, I intend on making this a website; thinking a db would be better. Matchup and winrate are updated everyday, I was planning to scrape it nightly. And neo4j is a graph based db, so with simple queries I can have it run things like minflow, shortest path, etc

Q: Why a graph based db?

A: Scraping and adding to db was easy, the real design work is figuring out an algorithm to: 
- select counter hero to as many enemy heroes as possible 
- fulfill the team roles (1 carry, a semi carry or two, some supports, an initiator, etc.)
- have it bias picks on heroes with certain strategies in mind like pushing, turtling, AOE Teamfight..
I figure the graph db best represents the data I am using. 
Queries such as `MATCH (hero_x)-[:counters]->(hero_y) RETURN hero_y` saves you a lot of work from implementing graph based selection algorithms. Plus, fun little introduction to graph dbs, as they are kinda different.
